Twitter is one of most popular micro-blogging social media platform. With a growing trend of people using social media as new source, Twitter is now gradually taking up a role as a newsagent. This project aims to uncover the similarity of the trend of a topic in traditional media and the trend of that topic in social media using a proposed framework. 

For this objective, data is collected in Melbourne, Australia to construct a corpus of news articles and a corpus of Twitter tweets. TF-IDF weighting algorithm is applied for topic extraction from the constructed news corpus. We also employed cross correlation analysis with the top 200 weighted topics to investigate the degree to which the trends of a topic in newspaper and in Twitter are correlated, and the time-lag at which the maximum correlation is achieved.

The results find that 78.5% of news topic correlation achieves greater than 0.6 which is a significant relation. The observation is further backed by distribution of time-lag as in a significant number of cases, Twitter reports breaking news faster than newspapers.
