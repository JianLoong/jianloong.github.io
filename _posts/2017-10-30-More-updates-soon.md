After being abandoned for 3 years, I have decided to actually revive this blog. 

It would be a good idea to put some thoughts into words as well as sharing my programming experience to others. 

It seems that just in the time of 3 years, JavaScript has taken over the world. I can still remember back then when everyone considers JavaScript to be the worst language of them all. My old professor said to me that, JavaScript component should always be loaded last and you should never use innerHTML inside your scripts. Apparently, that is all not true these days.......

Oh well, more post to come.
