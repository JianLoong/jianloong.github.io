For the past 2.5 years, I have been working as a Teaching Associate with Monash University. I have taught both at the undergraduate level as well as postgraduate level. Overall, I have assisted over 100 students every semester to understand the course material and taught them how to apply critical thinking to every aspect of their studies.

In my humble opinion, one of the main problems with the education industry is that the people involve in the education itself are often times not updated due to how fast technology is changing. This is even more true for IT subjects. However, the fundamental concepts will always remain the same, where the understanding of how to solve a problem takes precendence over everything else. That is what matters.

It is my personal belief that, it is more important for a student to understand the underlying concepts before approaching a problem. Understanding how to solve a problem takes precedence over making the same mistakes over and over again just to see what will work.
