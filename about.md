Hi,

Welcome to my blog. My research interest are mainly towards the optimisation of spatial queries. However, my hobbies are mainly programming related.

The posts here are normally programming related, and it is a way I organise my thoughts to solve a problem. Due to my OCD tendencies, I tend to delve in a problem for far too long in order to reach a solution. It has both goods and bad. 

The bad is obviously the fact, that over-engineering might happen and over-engineering might be bad. KISS still holds true as simple things are good even with regards to architecture.

*End of rant*
