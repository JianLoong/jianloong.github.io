      <title>Sentiment analysis for the subreddit Hong Kong</title>

      <description>Sentiment Analysis for the Sub-Reddit &amp;ldquo;HongKong&amp;rdquo; This post will perform sentiment analysis using AFINN. AFINN is a list of words rated for valence rated with an integer between minus five(negative) and plus five (positive). This implementation uses AFINN-en-165. 1
This approach however is a very naive approach as it does not build any models to determine the context of the usage of the word itself.

      <title>Reddit Word Cloud for the subreddit programming</title>

      <description>The word cloud generated here is based on the /r/programming subreddit for reddit.com
The reason this post is made, is so that it would easier to see the word that appeared the most for the day.
Even though the use of a word cloud is not exactly a good representation of occurrence, it still looks nice.

      <title>Percentage Charts for the subreddit Am I the Asshole?</title>

      <description>The charts here are visualisation of the Am I the Asshole? subreddit which can be found here
Basically the subreddit describes itself as&amp;hellip;
A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that&amp;rsquo;s been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you&amp;rsquo;re right, or you&amp;rsquo;re the asshole.</description>
