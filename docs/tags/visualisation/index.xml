      <description>The word cloud generated here is based on the website hacker news.
The reason this post is; is so that it would easier to see the word that appeared the most for the day.
Even though the use of a word cloud is not exactly a good representation of occurrence, it still looks nice.

      <title>Sentiment analysis for the subreddit Hong Kong</title>

      <description>Sentiment Analysis for the Sub-Reddit &amp;ldquo;HongKong&amp;rdquo; This post will perform sentiment analysis using AFINN. AFINN is a list of words rated for valence rated with an integer between minus five(negative) and plus five (positive). This implementation uses AFINN-en-165. 1
This approach however is very naive as it does not build any models to determine the context of the usage of the word itself.

      <description>The charts here are visualisation of the Am I the Asshole? subreddit which can be found here
The subreddit describes itself as&amp;hellip;
A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that&amp;rsquo;s been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you&amp;rsquo;re right, or you&amp;rsquo;re the asshole.</description>
