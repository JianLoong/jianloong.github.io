This post uses GA to generate a high-quality solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem.
Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm This blog post is regarding using a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. In a one-liner, the TSP asks the following question: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of the cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?</description>

      <description>This post is a simple implementation of Genetic Algorithm GA. Here, you would start with a random string and end up with the target string.
This post is heavily inspired based on this website. However, I created the codes with a very different methodology to also include newer JavaScript methods using classes and also web worker so it runs behind the scenes.
The implementation of it can be seen here</description>
