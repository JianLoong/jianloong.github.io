Let’s just take a very simple example of an Order object in an e-Commerce system. Something we all know quite well.\nAsking the client who wants the system is a very important part of the process. We can start off by asking thing like\nWhen a customer places an order what happens? - Placed What happens if there is nothing in stock? - Pending All these are just basic questions that can be asked, and we now we have the very first few states. It might be incorrect for now, but is the beauty of the modern iterative process.\nstateDiagram-v2\r[*] --\u003e Placed\rPlaced --\u003e Pending\rPending --\u003e [*]\rWhat we are interested now, is how the object moves from one state to another, so we will continue to ask the client\nWhat moves the order from the placed state to the pending state? So essentially, how does placed –\u003e pending?\nWhen does the order moves from placed to pending? Is this automated? Where the system checks availability? Or does someone manually checks it?\nDoes the customer need to pay before it moves to pending?\nAll these are just some questions we need to ask, so we can slowly understand the requirements\nstateDiagram-v2\r[*] --\u003e Placed\rPlaced --\u003e Pending: Payment is made\rPending --\u003e [*]\rNow we know one possible transition, but wait, we are not done. We need to continue asking the client questions, for example,\nWhat happens if the payment is not made? Can an orderstay in the placed state forever? If there is inventory management, what if the customer doesn’t pay? Are the products still held? So when does the deduction in the inventory happen? So, are you saying that the deduction in the inventory happens after the client makes a payment? What happens if the payment fails? Can a customer buy more than the items in stock? Things like that are known to us because we are used to using such a system, so now we can go back to the statechart based on what we learnt from the client.\nstateDiagram-v2\r[*] --\u003e Placed : Customer places an order, item must be in stock, item not deducted in inventory yet, no of items must not exceed inventory.\rPlaced --\u003e Pending\rPending --\u003e [*]\rStep 3 - More and more questions to understand the requirements\nNow we are at a stage, where we need to ask the clients more questions because, why would the placed state be needed in the first place? It seems to serve no purpose. Why not, the first state is pending? And the only way for an order to be in the pending state is when all the requirements are satisfied.\nSo, we just chuck away the placed state as it does nothing.\nstateDiagram-v2\r[*] --\u003e Pending : Customer places an order\rnote left of Pending\r- Item must be in stock\r- Item purchased must not exceed inventory\r- Item purchased must NOT be deducted yet\rend note\rPending --\u003e [*]\rWe can now move on and ask more and more questions to the client.\nSo lets try some by looking at our statechart,\nDo you want to allow the customers to purchase a huge number of items? Or is there a limit? What happens after pending? Do you want to call it paid? Or is there a different term? stateDiagram-v2\r[*] --\u003e Pending : Customer places an order\rnote left of Pending\r- Items must be in stock\r- Items purchased must not exceed inventory\r- Items purchased must not be deducted yet\r- Items purchased must not be above limit set\rend note\rPending--\u003ePaid: Customer pays for the order\rnote right of Paid\r- Payment must be successful\r- Items must still be in stock\r- Items are now deducted\rend note\rPaid --\u003e [*]\rNow we continue braining storm of the events.\nWhenever we have two or more states, what we are interested in is what events that could cause one state to become the other?\nSo for this situation, how does Paid –\u003e Pending. So back to the client we go…\nWhat happens if the customer unhappy after they have paid? What happens if the item in the stock house is incorrect and it is not in stock? Remember how we did not deduct the item at the pending state? Oh wow, it might cause issues. Should we have a cancelled state? stateDiagram-v2\r[*] --\u003e Pending : Customer places an order\rnote left of Pending\r- Items must be in stock\r- Items purchased must not exceed inventory\r- Items purchased must not be deducted yet\r- Items purchased must not be above limit set\rend note\rPending--\u003ePaid: Customer pays for the order\rnote right of Paid\r- Payment must be successful\r- Items must still be in stock\r- Items are now deducted\rend note\rPaid --\u003e Pending: Item no longer in stock, customer preference change.\rPaid --\u003e [*]\rThe more questions we ask, the more requirements and understanding of the system we will have. We know from this a few very important things\nIn order for an order to move from start to pending\nitems must be in stock items must not exceed the limit set (1000 PlayStation5?) items must not exceed stock system will not deduct the item stock at this stage For the order to be moved from pending to paid\npayment must be made and successful stock must be still in the system system will only now deduct the items Notice, that by going through the step by step process, we can now ask the client more questions for example\nWhen does the system deducts the item ordered by the user? Does it do it before he pays or after he pays? If the system does it after he pays, there might be times when other users, might be able to place an order but he cannot pay for it, do you want that to happen? If the system does it the minute after the place the order, how long do you want the system to hold it before the stock is returned?, what if the customer does not pay? Will this not be bad for business? Also, remember how the customer paid for the items but now we do not have it in stock? We are not done yet, though……………\nWhat about the cancelled state?\nThe idea here is that, statecharts will allow us to understand the requirements better and what to do. We can also now use enums better in our system as we now understand how each of them would happen. For the Order object, it is pretty clear to us, but most of the time we would be dealing with requirements and systems which are foreign to us.\nI hope this blog post is useful.\n","wordCount":"1174","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://jianloong.github.io/images/statechart.png","datePublished":"2021-10-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-10-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jian"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jianloong.github.io/posts/statechart/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jian","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jianliew.me/images/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://jianloong.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Jian (Alt + H)">Jian</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://jianloong.github.io/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jianloong.github.io/projects/ title=projects><span>projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jianloong.github.io/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jianloong.github.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jianloong.github.io/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jianloong.github.io/contact/ title=contact><span>contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://jianloong.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://jianloong.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>UML Statecharts</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-10-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>October 24, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jian</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Often times, students and even professional developers do not see a need for UML diagrams.</p><p>This post attempts to explain the train of thought while trying to make a statechart and why it is useful.</p><h3 id=what-are-statecharts>What are statecharts?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-are-statecharts>#</a></h3><p>Let&rsquo;s just take a very simple example of an <code>Order</code> object in an e-Commerce system.
