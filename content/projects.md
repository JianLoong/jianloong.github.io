### Reddit Crawler and Visualisation 

This project is a Reddit data crawler that does not depend on the Reddit API. It is meant to be run on a remote machine so cron jobs can be set up.
It also builds a simple dashboard based on a subreddit for demo purposes.

This project is inspired by the post [here](https//jianliew.me/posts/amitheasshole/)

### FIT5032 - Internet Applications Development

This project was done in the year 2018. I made major changes to both the readings and tutorial materials. 

The previous offerings of the unit were not done using the MVC architecture and still used WebForms.

Hopefully, since I am no longer working in Monash, the unit is still being updated and getting the love it deserves as an introduction unit.

### GeneticJS

This project was an extension inspired by the post made [here](https://jianliew.me/posts/tsp/) 

However during that, time, I was not able to dedicate enough of my time to complete the project. However, the baseline still exists and working, potentially
including it in future projects.
