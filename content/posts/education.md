### Introduction

A question that is often asked is **How fair is the marking process for exams?** The reason is because for certain subjects or units, there can be more than 300 students, and in order to achieve marking consistency policies are needed. This post here attempts to describe how marking is done according to the policies in place.

Please note that the opinions expressed here are my own and I am in no way representing the University. I am merely stating facts of how it is done based on my experience.

{{< figure src="/images/exampaper.png" title="" align="center">}}

Based on my experience working as both a Sessional Lecturer and Teaching associate since 2016, the process of marking is almost always the same for each unit within the Faculty, however the process and methodology might differ depending on the size of the class and people who are involved.

This post describes the marking of paper based exams, these days e-exams has simplified the marking process to a very high degree with human error is unlikely to occur.


### Marking Process

The process of marking exam papers generally take place as soon as the teaching team obtains the paper. This can be a few days or up to a week before we receive the papers. Depending on how the unit is structured and if the university have campuses overseas or distance learners, all exam papers are marked at the same location without fail. This ensures the marking quality is consistent across the different campuses.

Depending on the unit and the size of the class, there might be multiple people involve in the processing of marking. Generally, everyone who is teaching the unit and the person who prepares the exam paper would be involved in the marking process.

This is how the process normally starts off....

Let's assume the scenario of, a unit that has 300 students and there are 5 teaching associates that would be involved in the marking process. Depending, on the structure of the exam paper, often time it would consist of multiple questions and these questions would be divided upon the teaching team to be assessed.

For instance, the "Introduction to Programming" exam consist of 10 major questions. These will be a breakdown on how these questions are marked and by whom

- Teaching Associate A - marks question 1 and 2
- Teaching Associate B - marks question 3 and 4
- Teaching Associate C - marks question 5 and 6
- and so on

The reason this is needed is because, if multiple different people mark the same exact question, it would be considered in consistent. Most of the times, the teaching associate are people who are doing their PhD but they could also be from the industry working on that specific field. Thus the allocation of the question to the correct person is very important as well. The main reason for this is because, in the dawn of the internet where knowledge is widely available, it is an accepted fact that there are times, certain answers can be better than the accepted answer.

Besides that, for each question there will be also a **marking rubric**. The marking rubric outlines the amount of marks given for each answer. This is a complicated process as each answer and following description can be in varying range of how many marks is allocated. The construction of this marking rubric which outlines the accepted answer for the questions is generally constructed by the person who prepares the exam paper as well as the teaching team. If the marking rubric goes through a drastic change over the course of the marking process, there might be a need to remark **all** the papers to ensure the process is fair.

This marking rubric will then be updated, if a student answers with an *accepted* answer which is determined by the team during the marking process.

So, in summary, 

- each question in a exam is allocated to a single marker. (no matter how many papers it is, even if there are 500 students)
- a marking rubric created by teaching team is used to evaluate the answers, this marking rubric can be updated if an answer is accepted and not found in the marking rubric itself
- if the marking rubric is found to be inconsistent or incorrect, **all** papers will need to be remarked to ensure fairness

Besides that, there are also strict policies on the colour of the pen that is used to mark the paper. The first marking is always done using a certain colour. The reason for this is because if there is a need for remark, a different coloured pen will be used.

### Is my paper anonymous?

Most of the times, the exam papers comes to the teaching team are in the form of bundles. Each bundle can consist of 10 or 20 papers depending on how it is packed. These bundles are also numbered. On top of the bundle there will be a list of student IDs as well as their names. So, depending on how you view it, your bundle is anonymous but we do know your student ID. Majority of the time, this is not a concern of us as it would be too troublesome and tedious for us to lookup your name while we are marking the papers, and more importantly knowing your name has no impact on the marking process at all. So, in short, you can said that, it is anonymous to a certain extent. (Of course we can look you up using your student ID, unless there is some sort of mapping system in place)

### Don't spill coffee on my exam paper

Normally, we would avoid taking the exam papers home unless it is also absolutely needed. The reason for this is because, there have been incidents where members of the teaching team as well as the professor end up losing the bundles and needing an exam resit to happen. So, it is much more secure of the exam papers to be handled by the University and stored in a safe place.

### Marking continued...

Once the marking for a specific question is done, we would "transfer" the marks from the bottom of the question itself to the front of paper. (The place where you see boxes and the marks for each question). Here is probably one point where errors could happen as well.

Depending on the during of how long each question would take the mark, the marking would normally complete within less than a week of receiving the papers. However, this is not the end of the process, as we still need to calculate the marks and make sure there are no human errors.

For each question, a different marker would now calculate the marks that are tallied up and make sure it is transferred correctly to the front of the question. The reason this is needed is because often times, each question has many sub questions and more often than not, there will be a mistake during the counting of marks. This step is to ensure, the previous marker did not make a calculation mistake or a mistake during the transfer of the mark to the front of the page. So it is

- Teaching Associate B will check Question 1 and 2, to make sure the marks are calculated and transferred to the front correctly.
- Teaching Associate A will check Question 2 and 3, to do the same process....

Once this step is done, we move on to the next step where the numbers are transferred to an Excel sheet or Google Sheets. This is done via bundle number as we already know the marks in front of the exam papers are correct. 

### Reconfirm and reconfirm

Now, we will to ensure that process of confirmation of marks from the front of the exam paper to the Excel sheet. This excel sheet would normally have the breakdown of marks for each question. This is a very important step, because we need to understand the student's performance of each question. Here, normally the person who inputs the value into the sheet would be a different person that did the last step. So, remember how we had bundles? So a different person will check the bundles and transfer these marks to the Excel Sheet. (Basically just to confirm the marks are transferred from the front of the exam paper to the Excel Sheet are right). The Excel Sheet would serve as the final student marks in the exam.


### Evaluating the performance of each question

Here is what we know so far

- Each question is marked by a single person and marks are transferred to the front of the exam paper.
- The marks that are in front of the exam paper will be confirmed by another person
- The marks on the front of the exam paper are correct and transferred to the excel sheet

Now, we move on,


We are finally almost done but not yet......

We now have all the marks for each question on the Excel sheet we like to determine which questions the students are performing and which questions are not doing so well as compared to the other questions. The teaching team as whole would need to address this issue on why this is the case. This is a very important step because, there are times when the question itself is either flawed or inconsistent with the teaching material. Imagine the scenario where all students scored 0 for a question, there is obviously an issue with the question.

Here are some scenarios if a question is found out to be a **flawed question**

- the question will be removed from the final total, but students who scored marks there will still be given the marks. So, the final total of the paper could be less than 100 marks for instance 90, but there will be also students that have the potential to score more than 90 because, the question is removed, but the marks are still awarded for it.
- the entire question will be a bonus question, everyone gets the full mark for that question. This approach is not well liked as students that spend time attempting the question would feel as though it was not justified and not a preferred approach
- the question will be left there and scaling of markings will be done towards the end

Once the teaching team in combination with the professor has a made a choice on what to do, the marking process will move on. This process is normally done based on what the chief examiner thinks of how should the question should perform. (Each question in an exam would normally attempt to cover a learning objective outlined in the unit guide)

Do also note that it is actually possible for a question to perform badly because the person marking the question took a very serious approach, but it would also be consistent as all answers for that question is marked by a single individual.

One of the benefit of using Google Sheets or Excel is also that we have an audit trail of everything and the changes to the sheet.

### Remarking

Now begins one of the more tedious processes in an exam, the remarking phase. 

We now have all the marks in the Excel Sheet and we do know the number of failures as well as the near passes. Depending on the Faculty, the ``P`` grade is given to a student who achieves a mark of 50 and above, and anything below that is considered as ``NA``.

The process now is to evaluate everyone who is at the borderline marks to in order to achieve a passing mark. This process is often time done by the lead teaching associate or the person who prepared the paper. So, the marking will be repeated by a different person using the **enhanced marking rubric** in which the previous markers used. 

The remark will be done in a different coloured pen to indicate the paper has been remarked. 

It is **very** common for a remarked paper to not get any grade change because of the entire process and the way the marking is done. There have been multiple cases where it is impossible to give a student even 1 mark for a student to pass and there is nothing the teaching team could do about it. Because by giving a single mark, it would mean, all students have been marked unfairly. So it cannot **just happen**.


### Summary

I think the marking processes used is very fair and consistent. With such a marking process, the high achievers are very obvious because their performance would be consistent for all questions, as all of the markers agreed that all of the questions are answered really well. Not only that due to the numerous people involved and every step of the process, the chances of a human error happening is very low.

Also, because of how the marking it done, a student with near pass marks often times will not experience a grade change because of how everything is structured as finding even 1 mark out of sympathy and not using the marking rubric would mean **All answers to that question would need to be remarked** to ensure fairness for all students. So, it is a very rare occurrence it would happen. 

Conclusion is, exam marking is treated very seriously and with utmost respect. However, it would finally depend if the teaching team follows the laid out procedures set in place.
