Joshua Bloch. The 3rd edition has just been released couple months ago. I know quite a number of people have been eagerly waiting for its release.</p> <p>I have been programming Java for a fairly long time. I still remember learning it via self taught from a website called Java with Passion back in 2009. The person who runs it at that time was Sang Shin. He currently works at Pivotal There was even a Google Group created for discussion purposes. Back then, programming was still new to me and for me, it was mainly because I was interested in computers and how programs work in general.</p> <p>Anyways, back to the main topic, in this day and age, everyone claims to know Java. I mean of course, they do. But the main issue here is, how does a person determine the difference between a new Java programmer and someone who has been doing it for a long time. Cough, of course I know there are certifications like OCA and OJP out there. The main issue here is that for these certifications, one can “study” for it and most of the times it doesn’t become something ingrained within them.</p> <p>But Java itself is a huge, and there are many ways to tackle a problem. In my opinion, one thing that every programmer should always know is regarding good practices. The problem with good practices, its that it is hard to teach good practices, as this is something that can only be gained over time.</p> <p>For now, enough of the <em>rant</em>. let’s see some examples from the book.</p> <a href="/java/2018/04/08/Effective-Java-Static-Factory-Methods/">More &hellip;</a> </article> <article class="post-body"> <h2 class="post-title"> <a href="/react/2018/04/04/Thinking-in-React/"> Thinking in React </a> </h2> <div class="post-meta"> <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2018</span> <span class="post-categories"> &bull; React </span> </div> <p>I still remember during my undergraduate days, I took an elective called Web Development. In it, I was taught how to use HTML, JS as well as PHP. I still remember my lecturer for that unit as he was one of the best lecturers I have ever had.</p> <p>One thing that I remember is that I was told that we should always try to separate the JavaScript from the HTML. My teammate and I spend very long time just to figure out how to validate a simple form with JavaScript. Of course, the JavaScript was not inline :). Mind you, these were the days Mr Stack Overflow and Mr Google did not readily provide everything for you.</p> <p>Since then, I always followed the concept where there should never be inline scripts within HTML. However, it is now evident that, this might the old style of thinking. React uses something called <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, and it is the most mind boggling thing I have seen. Well, it is mind boggling to me. JSX mixes both HTML and JS together. At first glance, it looks like something out of the 80s horror movies.</p> <p>Why on earth would someone do that? Is there a reasoning behind this insanity? According to the React documentation it is stated that;</p> <a href="/react/2018/04/04/Thinking-in-React/">More &hellip;</a> </article> <article class="post-body"> <h2 class="post-title"> <a href="/use%20case/2018/04/02/Is-Login-A-Use-Case/"> Is Login A Use Case? </a> </h2> <div class="post-meta"> <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2018</span> <span class="post-categories"> &bull; Use Case </span> </div> <p>When dealing with system use case diagrams, a question that often pops up is the notion whether login is a use case? There are various train of thoughts regarding this matter.</p> <p>In my opinion, the answer to this question is in fact, really simple. Of course, login is a use case. However, the main question that comes into play now, is whether login is a <strong>functional</strong> or <strong>non-functional</strong> requirement. A functional requirement describes what a software system should do while a non-functional requirement place constraint on how the system will do so.</p> <p>The question now becomes, which category does login fall into in your system? Well, this answer depends on what system you are designing a use case diagram for. If you are designing an authentication and authorization system, of course login is a use case, but what happens if you are not?</p> <a href="/use%20case/2018/04/02/Is-Login-A-Use-Case/">More &hellip;</a> </article> <article class="post-body"> <h2 class="post-title"> <a href="/javascript/2017/11/08/Learning-Vue/"> Learning Vue </a> </h2> <div class="post-meta"> <span class="post-date">08 Nov 2017</span> <span class="post-categories"> &bull; <a href="/category/javascript/"> JavaScript </a> </span> </div> <p>Please note that I do know that is not the correct way of using Vue. This is just me playing around. Of course, in a real life production environment there are many things that should not be done at all.</p> <p>In order to learn Vue, I made this simple demonstration of how I can request the reddit API for certain subreddits.</p> <p>Here, I only included Programming and Programmer Humour in the select box at the moment. Upon selected, it will query the reddit API for results. While this could have been done with jQuery, I decided that I wanted to learn how to use Vue instead. I do know that you can even do this with basic JavaScript, however the intention of this post is to understand how VueJS work with regards to the bindings and etc.</p> <p>Even though the implementation seems simple, it actually took a while to understand the concepts behind it.</p> <p>I even tried looking at React, in the end I decided that Vue would be the choice for me for several reasons.
